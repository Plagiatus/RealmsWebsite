# RealmsWebsite
My attempt at making a website that allows you to modify your Minecraft Realm from outside the game

The plan is to make it run on a website in the future, but not before it's stable, safe and decetly functional.

## How to run for yourself

### Setup
1. Clone/Download Repo (duh)
1. make sure you have Node.js installed.
1. run `npm i` in both `/server` and `/MojangAPI`.

### Run
1. run `node ./server/main.js`
1. open `/client/index.html` in a browser of your choice (preferrably Firefox or Chrome)
That's it, now it's already running.

## Collaboration

Please, feel free to make a pull request and improve my code. It's a fun hobby project that I honestly didn't put too much effort into, so neither the visuals nor the code itself is super good.
