      <h3>This is an early alpha version</h3>
      <span>It's laggy, it's slow, it looks ugly and occasionally throws an error. I'm aware and working on that. :D</span>

      <h3>Why should I trust you with my login data?</h3>
      <span>
        Good question, thanks for asking. <br> 
        You shouldn't. It's as simple as that. Trust no-one who wants your login data for anything, other than the original company you've made that info for.<br>
        <br>
        And I would really like for this application to be server-less, browser/client side only, but sadly mojangs api servers don't allow requests from browsers directly,
        so I need a server to relay that request for you to be able to access the api. I've made the code open source, in part for that reason, so that everyone can open it up
        and see that nothing is logged other than error messages, that nothing is saved on the server and everything is saved in your browser (oh yeah btw, I'm using cookies for that).
