  <h1>Token Information</h1>

  <h2>What is a Token?</h2>
  <p>
    A token is a uniquely generated, long string of numbers and letters that basically serve as a way to authenticate
    you with a server without needing to re-send your password all the time.
    Lots of servers use this to authenticate you against their servers, and so does Mojang. A token is more secure than
    a Password in a way, because you can easily create a new one
    if you have the password, and you cannot get the password from the token. So even if your token is stolen, if
    they're lucky the best they can do is log into a server or two before the system
    notices something is up and asks you to log in again. <br>
    This is the reason you can also log in on this website using your token, so even IF somehow your data is stolen
    (we're doing our best, but we cannot guarantee anything), all they
    have is a soon-to-be-useless token and publicly available information (Username and UUID).
  </p>

  <h2>Where do i find my token?</h2>
  <p>
    You can find your token once you've logged in into the client once in a file located at
    <code>path/to/.minecraft/launcher_profiles.json</code>. <br>
    In this file you can find all the tokens for the various profiles you might be logged in with. Coincidentally you can also find all the other info you need for a token-login here.
    There is a part in it that might look something like this:<br>
    <pre>
      <code>
        "authenticationDatabase" : {
          "e9c7b9fc3c55418989ad6bf716ef594a" : {
            "accessToken" : "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJlOWM3YjlmYzNjNTU0MTg5ODlhZDZiZjcxNandMoreAndMoreAndEvenMore.TokensAreReallyLong.",      <- This is your token.
            "profiles" : {
              "e75e2d263b724a93a3e7a2491f4c454f" : {  <- This is your UUID
                "displayName" : "Plagiatus"           <- This is your username
              }
            },
            "properties" : [],
            "username" : "youremail@here.com"         <- This is your email
          }
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    This very long string is the token you need to copy and enter on this website. Since it is managed by the game, whenever you're getting a new token, the old one will not work anymore
    and you'll have to copy it again. But that's just a small price to pay for better security, isn't it?
